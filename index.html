          <p class="book-desc">Written and illustrated by Bill Martin Jr. and Eric Carle, the book is designed to help toddlers associate colors and meanings to objects. The plot consists of the narrator asking various animals and people what they see. Their response is an observation of another animal or person, which again prompts the initial question, “What Do You See?”</p>
